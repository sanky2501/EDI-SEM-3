# Predictive Maintenance using Random Forest

## Overview


Predictive Maintenance of Electric Batteries using Machine learning algorithm Random Forest. We used the dataset given by the Nasa's website. [Click Here](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/6/) for dataset. The dataset is of the Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset which contains data 21 sensors of each cycle of 250 engines and 3 operation settings.

We were able to successfully devise an algorithm to predict the RUL (Remaining useful life) for the engines. We have used the ML algorithm - Random Forest. After training our model, we tested the model and found out the accuracy and loss.
