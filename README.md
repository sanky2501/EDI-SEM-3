# Predictive Maintenance using Random Forest

## Overview

Predictive maintennance of Electric Battries using Machine learning algorithm Random Forest. We have use the dataset given by the Nasa's website. [Click Here] (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/6/) for dataset.

We were able to successfully devise an algorithm to predict the RUL (Remaining useful life) for the engines. We have used the ML algorithm - Random Forest. After training our model, we tested the model and found out the accuracy and loss.
